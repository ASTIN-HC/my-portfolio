      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>I’m a Graduate Assistant at NC State with a mechanical engineering background and a mindset for continuous improvement. Whether I’m in the garage with <strong>Pack Motorsports</strong> or optimizing housing operations for thousands of students, I bring energy, engineering, and empathy to everything I do. I care about building efficient systems, but more importantly, I care about the people who use them. Outside work? You’ll catch me chasing lap times, deep-diving analytics, or decoding anime plot twists.</p>
